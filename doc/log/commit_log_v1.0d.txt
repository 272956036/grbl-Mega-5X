Subject: Removed 328p-related code. Enabled options by default.

- Removed all of the 328p-related code, which seemed to clean up things
quite a bit without all those ifdefs everywhere.

- Since the 328p was very memory and flash limited, lots of
compile-time options were disabled by default. These have been now been
enabled by default. As they are considered generally helpful and does
not significantly impact how Grbl runs.

- For example, status reports can now report back real time feed rate
and line number being executed. Variable spindle is standard with a
separate spindle enable pin. Grbl will now check if a user setting has
exceeded the maximum step frequency and report an error, if so. And
finally, M7 flood coolant is enabled.

- In addition, all buffers have been significantly increased to take
advantage of the additional memory available. The planner buffer can
plan up to 36 motions. The serial buffers have been doubled in size
(256/128 bytes RX/TX). And the longest line Grbl can accept is 256
bytes, per the g-code standard (Grbl 328p is limited to 80).

- Removed the cpu_map folder, since this version is strictly Mega2560.
